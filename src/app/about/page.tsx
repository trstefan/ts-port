          The internet is my playground, and I love building websites and apps
          that are born and live there. I specialize in creating the visual side
          of things (front-end development) and making sure it's easy and
          enjoyable to use (user interface and experience design), but I'm also
          well-versed in some back-end functionalities to make sure everything
          runs smoothly.

          Think of me as your digital sidekick, turning problems into simple,
          beautiful, and accessible designs that anyone can use!

          I'm passionate about all kinds of projects, but the ones that truly
          energize me are those that make a positive impact. This passion fuels
          my love for creating software that helps others by making their lives
          easier, apps that brighten your day, and websites that promote equal
          rights.

          Currently working on writing better React code and learning Go and

          Online, I hang out on various platforms to get inspiration for my app
          ideas, watch anime and sports (we can talk Formula 1 and football) ,
          go down rabbit holes of all sorts, and learn how to build things for
          the web.

          Offline, I'm into lifting weights and calisthenics. For quite a long
          time, I've been working on becoming a master chef (of course, in my
          own kitchen). I enjoy a good walk in nature and petting my cats. Video
          games, I like those too.
